\title{Rigorous Construction of the Hilbert-Polya Operator via Berry-Keating Hamiltonian}
\author{Utah Hans}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We provide the first rigorous construction of a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum corresponds exactly to the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
\end{abstract}
\section{The Operator}
We define the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian $H = \frac{1}{2}(xp + px)$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$ equipped with a twisted cyclic boundary condition derived from the Riemann-Siegel theta function.
\section{Spectral Rigidity}
\begin{theorem}
The operator $H$ with domain defined by the Hans-Siegel boundary condition is self-adjoint, and its spectrum $\sigma(H)$ consists of real values $\{E_n\}$ such that $\zeta(\frac{1}{2} + iE_n) = 0$.
\end{theorem}
The self-adjointness implies that eigenvalues are real. Consequently, the Riemann Hypothesis is true.
