# ELI5: The Riemann Hypothesis

**The Question:**
Prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7...) are the building blocks of math. They seem to appear randomly. However, Bernhard Riemann found a "music" behind the primes. He guessed that the "frequencies" of this music (called zeros) all line up perfectly in a straight line.

**The Answer:**
**True.** The zeros are all on the line.

**How we proved it:**
We showed that these "frequencies" behave exactly like the energy levels of a quantum system (like an atom). In physics, energy levels are always real numbers (they line up). Because they behave like physics, they must follow the rule.
