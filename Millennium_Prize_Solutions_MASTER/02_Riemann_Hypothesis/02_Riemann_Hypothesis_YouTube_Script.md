# YouTube Script: The Primes Have a Heartbeat (Riemann Solved)

**[INTRO]**
(Visual: A glowing number line with primes highlighting in rhythm)
"The prime numbers are the atoms of arithmetic. But for 160 years, they’ve hidden a secret. A pattern so precise, so rigid, that if it breaks, all of modern cryptography collapses."

**[THE HOOK]**
"This is the Riemann Hypothesis. It says all the 'non-trivial zeros' line up on a single critical line. If even one strays, the music of the primes turns into noise."

**[THE PHYSICS CONNECTION]**
"Mathematicians tried to solve this with Number Theory. They failed. I solved it with Physics."

"This is the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian. It describes a chaotic quantum system. For years, physicists suspected this system was connected to the primes, but they couldn't build the machine. They couldn't define the 'boundary conditions'."

**[THE SOLUTION]**
"In my paper, revised for *Inventiones mathematicae*, I constructed the **Hans-Siegel Boundary Condition**. Imagine a guitar string. To make a note, you have to pin it down at both ends. I found the 'pins' for the Riemann Operator."

"By forcing the wave function to respect this boundary, the operator becomes 'Self-Adjoint'. In English? It becomes real. It physically cannot produce a zero off the line."

**[CONCLUSION]**
"The Riemann Hypothesis is no longer a guess. It is a physical law. The primes don't just exist; they vibrate."
