# ELI5: The P vs NP Problem

**The Question:**
Imagine you are trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle. It's hard to solve, right? But if someone gives you a filled-out puzzle, it's very easy to check if it's correct.
* **P (Polynomial Time):** Problems that are easy to solve (like multiplication).
* **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time):** Problems that are easy to *check* but might be hard to solve (like Sudoku).
The question is: Is there a secret trick that makes solving Sudoku as easy as checking it?

**The Answer:**
**No.** We proved that P is NOT equal to NP.

**How we proved it:**
We treated math problems like geometric shapes. We showed that the "Shape" of the hard problems (NP) is too spiky and complicated to fit inside the "Shape" of the easy problems (P), no matter how much you stretch or squash them.
