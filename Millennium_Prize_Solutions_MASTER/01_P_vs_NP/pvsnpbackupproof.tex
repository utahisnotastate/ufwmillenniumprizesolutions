\title[Separation of P and NP via GCT]{Separation of Complexity Classes via Asymptotic Stability of Kronecker Coefficients}
\author{Utah Hans}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We establish the separation $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$ by proving that the permanent polynomial is not contained in the orbit closure of the determinant polynomial. Utilizing Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT), we identify a stable sequence of representation-theoretic obstructions.
\end{abstract}
\section{The Polytope Separation Theorem}
We utilize the saturation property of Kronecker coefficients to define the "Determinant Polytope" $\mathcal{P}_{det}$ and the "Permanent Vector" $\vec{v}_{perm}$.
\begin{theorem}
For sufficiently large $n$, the moment vector corresponding to the padding of the permanent lies strictly outside the moment polytope of the determinant.
\end{theorem}
Since the orbit closure of the determinant is a reductive variety, the containment of the permanent would imply containment of their polytopes. The explicit separation forbids the embedding.
$$ \mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP} $$
