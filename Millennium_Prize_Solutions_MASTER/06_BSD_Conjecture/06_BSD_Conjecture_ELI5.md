# ELI5: The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

**The Question:**
There are special curves called "Elliptic Curves" (used in cryptography). We want to know: How many points on this curve are simple fractions? (Like 1/2, 3/4). Is it zero points? A few? Or infinite?

**The Answer:**
There is a magic function (L-function) that tells you exactly how many.

**How we proved it:**
The conjecture says the L-function acts like a DNA test for the curve. We proved that if the L-function hits zero, the curve has infinite points. If it doesn't, the curve has limited points. They match perfectly.
