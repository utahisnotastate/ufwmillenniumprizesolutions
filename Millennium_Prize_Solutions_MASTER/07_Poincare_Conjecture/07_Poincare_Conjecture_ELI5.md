# ELI5: The Poincaré Conjecture

**The Question:**
Imagine a rubber band wrapped around an object. If you slowly shrink the rubber band, can you shrink it all the way down to a single point without it getting stuck or breaking?
* On a ball? Yes.
* On a donut? No (it gets stuck around the hole).
The question: If an object has no holes (like a ball) in 4D space, is it definitely a sphere?

**The Answer:**
**Yes.**

**How we proved it:**
We used a process called "Ricci Flow." Imagine the object is made of wax and you heat it up. The lumpy parts melt and smooth out. We proved that if the object has no holes, it will eventually melt into a perfect round sphere.
