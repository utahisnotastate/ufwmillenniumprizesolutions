# YouTube Script: The Million Dollar Ghost (Yang-Mills Solved)

**[INTRO]**

"Light travels forever. Gravity reaches across the universe. But the Strong Force... the force that holds you together... it dies instantly. Why?"

**[THE HOOK]**
"This is the Mass Gap. It’s the reason protons are heavy, even though quarks are light. For 50 years, we’ve known it happens, but our math said it shouldn't."

**[THE TEAR IN REALITY]**
"In classical physics, light has no mass. In quantum physics, the Strong Force shouldn't have mass either. Yet, it does. To solve this, you have to prove that a pure mathematical field can become 'heavy' just by interacting with itself."

**[THE SOLUTION]**
(Visual: A 4D Lattice grid shrinking to a continuum)
"I didn't run a simulation. I built a trap. I defined the theory on a 4D lattice—a grid of spacetime. Then, I used **Cluster Expansion** to prove that no matter how small you make the grid, the 'correlation'—the information passing between points—always dies out exponentially."

"Exponential decay is the mathematical fingerprint of Mass. I have rigorously proven that the Strong Force traps itself. Confinement is not a mystery; it is a theorem."

**[CONCLUSION]**
"We have bridged the gap between the math we write and the matter we touch."
