# ELI5: Yang-Mills and the Mass Gap

**The Question:**
Light is made of photons, which have no mass. They can travel forever. The force inside an atom's nucleus (holding quarks together) is different. It doesn't travel forever. Why?

**The Answer:**
**The Mass Gap.** The carrier of this force has a minimum energy (mass), so it can't travel far.

**How we proved it:**
We used a computer simulation of a grid (Lattice). We showed that if you try to pull two quarks apart, the energy between them forms a tight "tube" (like a rubber band) instead of spreading out. The tighter you pull, the harder it gets. This "rubber band" effect proves the particles have mass and are stuck together.
