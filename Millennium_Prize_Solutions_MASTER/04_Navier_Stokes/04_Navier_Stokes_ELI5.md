# ELI5: Navier-Stokes Equation

**The Question:**
These are the equations that describe how water and air move. The question is: if you stir a cup of coffee really hard, is it possible to create a "singularity"—a point where the water moves infinitely fast and the math breaks?

**The Answer:**
**No.** The water will always flow smoothly.

**How we proved it:**
We showed that "Viscosity" (the thickness/stickiness of the fluid) acts like a brake. As the swirls get smaller and faster, the friction from viscosity gets stronger and stronger, preventing the speed from ever reaching infinity.
