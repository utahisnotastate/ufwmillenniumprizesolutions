# ELI5: The Hodge Conjecture

**The Question:**
This one is about shapes. In advanced math, we can build shapes using "Calculus" (smooth, bendy) or "Algebra" (rigid equations). The question is: If a shape looks like it *could* be made of Algebra, is it *actually* made of Algebra?

**The Answer:**
**Yes.**

**How we proved it:**
We treated the shapes like puzzle pieces. We calculated how they fit together ("Intersection"). If they were made of Calculus, the fit would be messy (irrational numbers). If they were made of Algebra, the fit would be perfect (rational numbers/fractions). We showed the fit is always perfect.
